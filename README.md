## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**pcsutton72/pcsutton72** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on increasing my knowledge of operating systems and their associated tools.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux along with GitHub.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet.  I'll fly solo and Google any questions I have.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with being a better human.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my interesting primary employment and how different it is from this platform.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: email - patricksutton72@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: The first time I ever flew in a plane was when I was 18 years old.  I flew from RDU to Savannah/Hilton Head SC before arriving at MCRD Parris Island.
